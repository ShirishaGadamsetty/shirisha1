Whenever one or more badges for other app platforms appear in the layout, use the preferred black badge. Place the App Store badge first in the lineup of badges.</p>

The alternative badge is suitable when only one badge appears in the layout and when it complements the colors used in the layout.

							<p>Use one App Store badge per layout or video. Place the badge in a subordinate position to the image or main message so that it isn’t the dominant artwork. Don't modify, angle, or animate the App Store badge.</p>
							<p>Use the pre-order badge to indicate that your app is available for pre-order on the App Store. Once the app is released for download, be sure to replace the pre-order badge with the download badge in all of your marketing materials. For more information on making your apps available for pre-order, see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/pre-orders/">Offering Your Apps for Pre-Order</a>.</p>
							<p>Use only the badge artwork provided in these guidelines. Don't use icons, logos, graphics, or images from www.apple.com to promote your app. Never use the Apple logo in place of the word <em>Apple</em>. Don't use the standalone Apple logo.</p>

							<h3 class="typography-subsection-headline">Screen Content</h3>
							<p>Focus on the experience of using your app and not on Apple product functions. Display your app on the screen as it appears when your app is running. For apps that work within Messages, Siri, Phone, or Maps, display your app within the Apple UI exactly as it appears when your app is running. Be sure to create screens using the latest operating system version. Don't display a blank screen on an Apple product, or on a television screen when showcasing Apple&nbsp;TV.</p>
							<p>You are responsible for securing the rights to all materials used in screen content within your app, and you should display fictional account information instead of data from a real person.

							<h4 class="typography-label">Status bar</h4>
							<p>The status bar for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch should show a full network icon or product designator, a full Wi-Fi icon, and a full battery icon. If your app runs full screen, you can extend your app screen image over the status bar.</p>

							<p>For product images of iMac, MacBook&nbsp;Pro, and MacBook&nbsp;Air in the desktop display option, remember to add your icon to the Dock and customize the menu bar titles to match your app’s menu bar.</p>

							<h3 class="typography-subsection-headline">Product Use</h3>
							<p>Straight-on product shots are preferred. Don't use extreme angles or alter an Apple product in any way. The product’s color, shape, size, and form must be accurate. Don't engage in “suspension of disbelief” by showing Apple products or your app in a fantastic or unrealistic manner.</p>
							<p>Only show the back of a device in an authentic manner to illustrate natural use of the device. Don't feature the Apple logo to take advantage of the promotional value of the Apple brand. Don't obscure or cover the logo. </p>
							<p>In video, once you show an establishing shot of the entire Apple device, you may pan and zoom to focus on your app. Present the movement in a simple, clear manner. Use straightforward transitions such as fade or dissolve. Don't use Apple user interaction gestures such as Multi-Touch or trackpad swipes to perform scene transitions.</p>
							<p>Start the app sequence with your app open. If app sequences are shortened, display a “sequences shortened” disclaimer. You can use the sounds that your app makes naturally as audio elements of your video, but don't use the native sounds of the Apple device.</p>

						<div class="column large-8 small-12">
							<h2 class="typography-section-headline">Messaging and Writing Style</h2>
							<p>When promoting your app, your headline and copy should focus on your app, not on Apple product features. Use clear, simple messaging. Always include a call to action to download your app.</p>
							<p>Refer to the correct product names your app supports, and avoid referring to iOS, macOS, tvOS, or watchOS in your marketing communications. Don't refer to Apple devices generically as “smartphones” or “tablets.” Use the product names.</p>

							<h3 class="typography-subsection-headline">Product Names</h3>
							<p>Use Apple product names such as Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Apple&nbsp;TV in a referential phrase to indicate that your app is compatible with these products. For example, say <em>app name for iPhone</em> or <em>app name for iPad</em>, or use a phrase such as <em>works with</em> or <em>compatible with</em>. Don't say <em>iPhone app name</em>.</p>
							<p>List all the Apple products that your app runs on. Don't list Apple products that are not compatible with your app.</p>
							<!-- The order might be different for localized versions. -->
							<p>When including your company name, lead with the company name followed by the app name and end with the appropriate Apple product names. For example, it is correct to say <em>Company name App name for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch</em>.</p>

							<h4 class="typography-label">Spelling and language</h4>
							<p>Always use the correct Apple product names with the correct capitalization as shown on the <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/trademark/appletmlist.html">Apple Trademark List</a>. Always use Apple product names in singular form. Modifiers such as <em>model</em>, <em>device</em>, or <em>collection</em> can be plural or possessive. Never typeset Apple product names using all uppercase letters.</p>

							<h4 class="typography-label">iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch</h4>
							<p>Always typeset <em>iPhone</em>, <em>iPad</em>, or <em>iPod touch</em> with a lowercase <em>i</em> and an uppercase <em>P</em> followed by lowercase letters. Always typeset <em>touch</em> with a lowercase <em>t</em>. The name <em>iPhone</em>, <em>iPad</em>, or <em>iPod touch</em> should start with a lowercase <em>i</em> even when it is the first word in a sentence, paragraph, or title. Don't use variations such as <em>touch</em> or <em>iTouch</em>. Never use a lowercase <em>i</em> followed by all uppercase letters.</p>
							<!-- Un-DNT for Simplified Chinese. -->							
							<p>When promoting 3D Touch or Apple Pencil enabled app features, don't translate <em>3D Touch</em> or <em>Apple Pencil</em>.</p>

							<h4 class="typography-label">MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and iMac</h4>
							<p><em>Mac</em> is always set with an uppercase <em>M</em> followed by lowercase letters; <em>MacBook</em> is one word with an uppercase <em>M</em> and <em>B</em>; and <em>iMac</em> always begins with a lowercase <em>i</em> followed by an uppercase <em>M</em> followed by lowercase letters. <em>iMac</em> begins with a lowercase <em>i</em> even when it is the first word in a sentence.</p>

							<h4 class="typography-label">Apple Watch</h4>
							<p>Always typeset Apple Watch as two words with an uppercase <em>A</em> and an uppercase <em>W</em> followed by lowercase letters. Don't break <em>Apple Watch</em> over two lines. Don't use the article <em>the</em> before <em>Apple Watch</em>. Apple Watch apps are <em>available on the App Store</em> or can be <em>downloaded on the App Store</em>. It is acceptable to say <em>Name of app for Apple Watch</em> when your promotion is focused on your app features and benefits related to Apple Watch.</p> 
							<p>When promoting your app, your headlines and copy should focus on your app, not on Apple Watch features. Don't use the word <em>watch</em> or <em>time</em> as a pun or verb in your marketing materials.</p>
							<p>When referring to Apple Watch, use the term <em>Apple Watch Series 1</em> or <em>Apple Watch Series 3</em>, depending on the features and functionality available in your app.</p>

							<h4 class="typography-label">Apple TV</h4>
							<p><em>Apple TV</em> is typeset as two words with an uppercase <em>A</em> followed by lowercase letters, and an uppercase <em>TV</em>. If your app is offered only for Apple TV, clarify that your app is exclusive to Apple TV and available only from the App Store on Apple TV.</p>

							<h4 class="typography-label">App Store</h4>
							<p>Always typeset <em>App Store</em> with an uppercase <em>A</em> and an uppercase <em>S</em> followed by lowercase letters.</p>
							<p>Refer to just the <em>App Store</em> unless you need to be more specific; in that case, you can use <em>App Store for iPhone</em>, <em>App Store for iPad</em>, <em>Mac App Store</em>, <em>App Store for Apple TV</em>, <em>App Store for Apple Watch</em>, or <em>App Store for iMessage</em>. To refer to all the versions, use this order: <em>App Store for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and iMessage</em>. Don’t use terms such as <em>Apple Watch App Store</em> or <em>App Store for watchOS</em>.</p>
							<p>Include only the article <em>the</em> before App Store and Mac App Store. Never include other descriptors; for example, don't say <em>iTunes App Store</em>, <em>Apple App Store</em>, or <em>iPhone App Store</em>. Don't add superlatives such as <em>the best</em> App Store. It is correct to say that an app is <em>available on</em> the App Store or <em>can be downloaded from the App Store</em> . Don't use <em>at the App Store</em>. Don't use the term <em>downloadable</em>.</p>

							<h4 class="typography-label">Apple apps and services</h4>
							<p>When using the Apple names <em>Apple Pay</em>, <em>Wallet</em>, <em>Messages</em>, <em>Siri</em>, <em>Phone</em>, or <em>Maps</em>, always typeset with a capital letter. iMessage, the service within the Messages app, must be spelled with a lowercase <em>i</em> and an uppercase <em>M</em> followed by lowercase letters.</p>

							<h4 class="typography-label">Other platforms</h4>
							<p>Apple product names can appear in copy along with the names of other app platforms or devices. List Apple products first. Although the names of other products can be used in promotional copy, never display Apple product images alongside the images of other products.</p>

							<h4 class="typography-label">URL address naming</h4>
							<p>Apple trademark names can be included in your URL address only when the trademark follows your company and/or product name. Apple trademarks can be used in URLs only for web pages that feature apps developed specifically for the Apple product named. Never start a URL with an Apple trademark.</p>

							<p>In communications distributed only in the United States, the appropriate symbol (™, ℠, or ®) must follow each Apple trademark the first time it is mentioned in body copy.</p>

							<p>For example, use <em>Apple Watch®, iPhone®, iPad®, iPod touch®, Apple TV®, and App Store®, Mac App Store℠, Mac®, MacBook Pro®, MacBook Air®</em>, and <em>iMac®</em>.</p>

							<p>Don't add symbols to headline copy or to the App Store badge artwork provided by Apple.</p>

							<h3 class="typography-subsection-headline">Credit lines</h3>

							<p>Use the appropriate credit lines in all communications worldwide, listing all the Apple trademarks used in your communication.

Follow standard practices for the placement of legal copy, such as creating additional screens or providing interactive links. When the App Store badge is used, credit both Apple and the Apple logo.</p>

							<p>For example, say <em>Apple, the Apple logo, iPhone, and iPad are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries and regions. App Store is a service mark of Apple Inc.</em></p>

							<p>With Apple’s approval, a translation of the legal notice and credit lines (but not the trademarks) can be used in materials distributed outside the U.S. Never translate an Apple trademark.</p>

APPLE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES REGARDING THE ARTWORK, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT. APPLE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE ARTWORK, OR TERMINATION OF THIS MARKETING AGREEMENT.</p>
					<p>8. To the extent permitted by applicable law, You agree to indemnify and hold harmless, and upon Apple’s request, defend, Apple, its directors, officers, employees, independent contractors and agents (each an "Apple Indemnified Party") from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, taxes, expenses and costs, including without limitation, attorneys’ fees and court costs, incurred by an Apple Indemnified Party and arising from or related to Your use of the Artwork in any manner except as expressly permitted by this Marketing Agreement, or for any personal injury, product liability or other claim arising from the production, promotion, distribution, sale and/or offer for sale, and/or the performance of the Applications.</p>
					<p>9. This Marketing Agreement is valid and coterminous with the Program Agreement, unless otherwise terminated per the provisions below.</p>
					<p>10. This Marketing Agreement shall terminate automatically upon Your breach of any of the terms of this Marketing Agreement. Apple may terminate this Marketing Agreement at will upon 10 days’ written notice. If Apple terminates this Marketing Agreement, You may, except in the event that the Artwork is subject of a claim of infringement, deplete existing inventory for a period of 30 days following the notice of termination, provided such inventory is in compliance with the terms of this Marketing Agreement.</p>
					<p>11. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple arising out of or relating to this Marketing Agreement will take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of and exclusive venue in the state and federal courts within that District with respect any such litigation or dispute resolution. This Marketing Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law.</p>
					<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if You are an agency, instrumentality or department of the federal government of the United States, then this Marketing Agreement shall be governed in accordance with the laws of the United States of America, and in the absence of applicable federal law, the laws of the State of California will apply. Further, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Marketing Agreement (including but not limited to Section 8), all claims, demands, complaints and disputes will be subject to the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. §§601-613), the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C. § 1346(a) and § 1491), or the Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2401-2402, 2671-2672, 2674-2680), as applicable, or other applicable governing authority.</p>
					<p>If You (as an entity entering into this Marketing Agreement) are a U.S. public and accredited educational institution, then (a) this Marketing Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the state (within the U.S.) in which Your educational institution is domiciled, except that body of state law concerning conflicts of law; and (b) any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple arising out of or relating to this Marketing Agreement will take place in federal court within the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of and exclusive venue of such District unless such consent is expressly prohibited by the laws of the state in which Your educational institution is domiciled.</p>
					<p>This Marketing Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any clause of this Marketing Agreement to be unenforceable for any reason, that clause of this Marketing Agreement shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Marketing Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
					<p>12. You shall promptly notify Apple in writing of any change in Your physical or electronic address via the App Store Connect tool and/or the Apple Developer website.</p>
					<p>3. The terms of this Marketing Agreement are the entire and final understanding between You and Apple concerning the Artwork.</p>
